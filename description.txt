The goal of this application is to show temprerature information of the weather stations from the last 24 hours.
On the map are presented all the weather stations. The color of the station depends if the temperature is below or over 0 Celsius degrees.
At first the sidebar displays the maximum and minimum tempretature from all the weather stations.
Once a weather station is chosen, relevant weather information from that station is displayed. 

Changes 
	App.js
		The problem in the beginning was that the coordinates lon, lat where in wrong order in the function setObservationLocations.
		New html-marker style added, used instead of the leaflet-icon. 
			Adjusted the color of the marker to depend on the data.
		Edits in the API request: 
			Observations from the last 24 hours, newest from 90 minutes ago, because there is delay on the measurements on some stations. 
			Request only for temperature, because no other weather information is used.
		Mapcontainer:
			Added LayerControl and new basemap
			Conditional icon for weather station marker to display temperature on map
			Added popup for the weather station markers to display station name and temperature
		Refactored the code to be more consistent (indentations, quotations etc).

	Sidebar.js
		Implemented styling for the sidebar
			Map legend also displayed on the sidebar
		Looped through the weather station data to find max and min temperatures from the last 24 hours for active station
		Calculated the average tempretature from the last 24 hours
		Displayed calculated weather information and its time
		If no weather station is chosen, the temprerature extremes are displayed

	Extremes.js
		Calculated the max and min temperatures from the last 24 hours by looping through all the stations and their temperatures
