# Bug fixing
- Inside Sidebar component created a **WrapperSidebar** to wrap a div before class exporting.
# Project refactor
- Moved the **observation location fetching** out of **App.js** and put it under the **services** folder. So every service that we call from the Rest APIs we will put to this folder.
- Created a **components** folder to store all component of project.
- Moved **SidebarComponent** from **src** to **components**.
- Moved **MapContainer** out of **App.js** by creating a new **MapComponent** component
- Created 2 new components (**ThemeComponent**, **WeatherComponent**) to handle map's theme and show realtime weather of selected location.
- Moved the **LocationGetter** under **utils** folder.
# Weather information and map visualizations
- Add more functions to the map like dragging, zooming, scrolling, animate, baselayers...etc
- Moved all markers to the middle of screen.
- Change map's theme from dark to lighter color.
- Styled the sidebar.
- Show location's name when hovering marker.
